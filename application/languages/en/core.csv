<h3>Information we receive about you</h3>
<p>We receive a number of different types of information about you, including:</p>

<h4>Your information</h4>
<p>Your information is the information that's required when you sign up for the site, as well as the information you choose to share.</p>

<h4>Registration information</h4>
<ul>
	<li>When you sign up for My Global Sport Link, you are required to provide information such as your name, email address, birthday, and gender.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Information you choose to share</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Your information also includes the information you choose to share on My Global Sport Link, such as when you post a status update, upload a photo, or comment on a friend's photo. It also includes the information you choose to share when you take an action, such as when you add a friend, join a circle.</li>

	<li>Your name, profile pictures, gender, networks, username and User ID are treated just like information you choose to make public.</li>

	<li>Your birthday allows us to do things like show you age-appropriate content and advertisements.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Information others share about you</h4>
<ul>
	<li>We receive information about you from your friends and others, such as when they post a photo of you, tag you in a photo or status update, or add you to a Circle.</li>

	<li>When people use My Global Sport Link, they may store and share information about you and others that they have, such as when they upload and manage their invites and contacts.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Other information we receive about you</h4>

<p>We also receive other types of information about you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We receive data about you whenever you interact with My Global Sport Link, such as when you look at another person's CV, send or receive a message, search for a friend or a Circle, click on, view or otherwise interact with things, use a My Global Sport Link mobile app, or make purchases through My Global Sport Link.</li>
	
	<li>When you post things like photos or videos on My Global Sport Link, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you took the photo or video.</li>

	<li>We receive data from the computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access My Global Sport Link, including when multiple users log in from the same device. This may include your IP address and other information about things like your internet service, location, the type (including identifiers) of browser you use, or the pages you visit. For example, we may get your GPS or other location information.</li>

	<li>Sometimes we get data from our affiliates or our advertising partners, customers and other third parties that helps us (or them) deliver ads, understand online activity, and generally make My Global Sport Link better. For example, an advertiser may tell us information about you (like how you responded to an ad on My Global Sport Link or on another site) in order to measure the effectiveness of &mdash; and improve the quality of &mdash; ads.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also put together data from the information we already have about you and your friends. For example, we may put together data about you to determine which friends we should show you in your News Feed or suggest you tag in the photos you post. We may put together your current city with GPS and other location information we have about you to, for example, tell you and your friends about people or events nearby, or offer deals to you that you might be interested in. We may also put together data about you to serve you ads that might be more relevant to you.</p>

<p>When we get your GPS location, we put it together with other location information we have about you (like your current city). But we only keep it until it is no longer useful to provide you services, like keeping your last GPS coordinates to send you relevant notifications.</p>

<p>We only provide data to our advertising partners or customers after we have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you.</p>

<h4>Public Information</h4>

<p>When we use the phrase &ldquo;public information&rdquo; (which we sometimes refer to as &ldquo;Everyone information&rdquo;), we mean the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly available.</p>

<h5>Information you choose to make public</h5>

<p>Choosing to make your information public is exactly what it sounds like: anyone, including people off of My Global Sport Link, will be able to see it.</p>

<p>Choosing to make your information public also means that this information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>can be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile pictures, , CV, User ID, username, etc.) even off My Global Sport Link;</li>
	<li>can show up when someone does a search on My Global Sport Link or on a public search engine;</li>
	<li>will be accessible to anyone who uses our APIs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes you will not be able to select an audience when you post something This is because some types of posts are always public posts. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available.<br />
When others share information about you, they can also choose to make it public.</p>

<h4>Information that is always publicly available</h4>

<p>The types of information listed below are always publicly available, and are treated just like information you decided to make public.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Name</strong><br />
		This helps your friends and family find you. If you are uncomfortable sharing your real name, you can always delete your account. 
	</li>

	<li>
		<strong>Profile Pictures</strong><br />
		These help your friends and family recognize you. If you are uncomfortable making any of these photos public, you can always delete it. Unless you delete them, when you add a new profile picture the previous photo will remain public in your profile picture album.
	</li>

	<li>
		<strong>Network</strong><br />
		This helps you see whom you will be sharing information with before you choose &ldquo;Friends and Networks&rdquo; as a custom audience.
	</li>

	<li>
		<strong>Gender</strong><br />
		This allows us to refer to you properly.
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>How we use the information we receive</h4>

<p>We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you and other users like your friends, our partners, the advertisers that purchase ads on the site. For example, in addition to helping people see and find things that you do and share, we may use the information we receive about you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>as part of our efforts to keep My Global Sport Link products, services and integrations safe and secure;</li>
	
	<li>to protect My Global Sport Link's or others' rights or property;</li>

	<li>to measure or understand the effectiveness of ads you and others see, including to deliver relevant ads to you;</li>
	
	<li>to make suggestions to you and other users on My Global Sport Link, such as: suggesting that your friend use our contact importer because you found friends using it, suggesting that another user add you as a friend because the user imported the same email address as you did, or suggesting that your friend tag you in a picture they have uploaded with you in it; and</li>

	<li>for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide My Global Sport Link as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways.</p>
<p>While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't share information we receive about you with others unless we have: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>received your permission;</li>
	<li>given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or</li>
	<li>removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, for information others share about you, they control how it is shared.<br />
We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above. Typically, information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted. For certain categories of data, we may also tell you about specific data retention practices.</p>

<h4>Management and security</h4>

<p>We have appointed a Privacy Officer to oversee the management of personal information in accordance with this policy and the Privacy Act.</p>

<p>Other than in relation to Non-Confidential Information, we will take all reasonable steps to protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, loss, or unauthorised access, including by means of firewalls, pass word access, secure servers and encryption of credit card transactions.</p>

<p>However, you acknowledge that the security of online transactions and the security of communications sent by electronic means cannot be guaranteed. You provide information to us via the internet or by post at your own risk. We cannot accept responsibility for misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your personal information where the security of information is not within our control.</p>

<p>You acknowledge that we are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of any third party (including third parties that we are permitted to disclose your personal information to in accordance with this policy or any applicable laws). The collection and use of your information by such third party/ies may be subject to separate privacy and security policies.</p>

<p>If you suspect any misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your personal information, please let us know immediately.</p>

<h5>Accessing and updating your information and how to contact us.</h5>

<p>Subject to some exceptions in the Privacy Act, you have the right to seek access to and update the personal information we hold about you. If you make an access request, we will ask you to verify your identity. We may charge a fee to cover the costs of meeting your request.</p>

<p>Members of our websites will generally be able to access and update their membership details online.</p>

<p>We request that you keep your information as current as possible so that we may continue to improve our service to you.</p>

<p>If you would like to seek access to personal information we hold about you, or if you have any questions or complaints about how we collect, use, disclose, manage or store your personal information, you can contact the department that collected your personal information in the first instance, email info@myglobalsportlink.com</p>

<h4>Deleting and deactivating your account</h4>

<p>If you want to stop using your account, you can either deactivate or delete it.</p>

<h5>Deactivate</h5>
<p>Deactivating your account puts your account on hold. Other users will no longer see your timeline, but we do not delete any of your information. Deactivating an account is the same as you telling us not to delete any information because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the future.<br />
You can deactivate your account on your account settings page.<br />
Your friends will still see you listed in their list of friends while your account is deactivated.</p>

<h5>Deletion</h5>
<p>
When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from My Global Sport Link. It typically takes about one month to delete an account, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days. You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it. You can delete your account from the account settings pages.</p>
<p>Certain information is needed to provide you with services, so we only delete this information after you delete your account. Some of the things you do on My Global Sport Link aren't stored in your account, like posting to a group or sending someone a message (where your friend may still have a message you sent, even after you delete your account). That information remains after you delete your account.

"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_DESCRIPTION";"For very large social networks,
it may be necessary to enable caching to improve performance. If there is a noticable
decrease in performance on your social network, consider enabling caching below
(or upgrading your hardware). Caching takes some load off the database server by
storing commonly retrieved data in temporary files (file-based caching) or memcached
(memory-based caching). If you are not familiar with caching, we do not recommend
that you change any of these settings."
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_LIFETIME_DESCRIPTION";"This determines how long
the system will keep cached data before reloading it from the database server. A
shorter cache lifetime causes greater database server CPU usage, however the data
will be more current. We recommend starting off with 60-120 seconds."
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_TYPE_DESCRIPTION";"If you have enabled
caching above, please select the type of caching that you want to use. Memcache
caching (if available) will use memory (RAM) which is not as abundant as disk
space, however it will be faster than file-based caching when performing
read/write operations"
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_FILE_PATH_DESCRIPTION";"This is where the
temporary files containing the cached data are stored. Folder must be writable
(chmod 777). This should be a path relative to the base directory where
SocialEngine is installed."
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_ENABLE_DESCRIPTION";"Enable caching? Enabling
caching will decrease the CPU
usage of your database server (resulting in a decrease of page load
times). While some non-critical data may appear slightly out of date,
this will usually not be noticeable to users. For example, some of the
general site statistics on your homepage may take longer to update.
This will not be noticeable if your social network is already large and
populated with a lot of data"
