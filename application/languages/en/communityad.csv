"Q What is Ad Targeting?";"Q What is Ad Targeting?"
"Ans: Ad targeting enables advertisers to reach their target audience which is more likely to be interested in their ads. If an ad package allows targeting, then advertisers using it will be able to configure targeting for their ad based on user profile fields. Only users having profiles matching with the targeting criteria will be shown the targeted ad. You can configure settings for ads targeting from the Targeting Settings section. Basic targeting occurs on specific profile fields (gender, city, country, education, interests, etc). Advanced targeting occurs such that advertiser will be able to select the Profile Type to which the ad should be targeted and the generic profile fields for that profile type on which targeting should be done.";"Ans: Ad targeting enables advertisers to reach their target audience which is more likely to be interested in their ads.

"Q: I have created an Ad in the paid package and then approved it manually from ""Manage Advertisements"" section without making the payment.

What can be the reason ?";"Q: I have created an Ad in the paid package and then approved it manually from ""Manage Advertisements"" section without making the payment. But it is showing only 5 views in the ""Remaining"" column while the package this Ad belongs to says 100,000 views. What can be the reason ?"

"Ans: In this case, you have actually approved the Ad from admin side without paying for it. While plugin provides '5 views' in case Ad belongs to package 'Pay for views' and '1 click' in case Ad belongs to package 'Pay for clicks' as for a trial to the advertiser and after those 5 views are done and payment is still not made, the ad gets expired automatically.<br /><br />So, now if you want to continue that advertisement without payment, then after making it 'Approved' from 'Manage Advertisements' section, you will also have to renew it by clicking on 'Renew' link in the right most 'Options' column. It will renew the Ad and will give it 100,000 Views.";"Ans: In this case, you have actually approved the Ad from admin side without paying for it.

"_communityad_help_sponsored_story_qus_1";"What are Sponsored Stories?"
"_communityad_help_sponsored_story_ans_1";"Sponsored Stories are social ads that enable you to get more distribution and visibility for user interaction with your content from this community. These always include stories of relevant actions by viewer's friends on your content. Example: Viewer's friends Liking your content. With Sponsored Stories, viewers will be able to Like your content inline on-the-spot. Such Like actions will lead to a viral promotion of your content as your Sponsored Story will then also be viewable to the viewer’s friends.<br />
Sponsored Stories will appear in their highly visible blocks in the columns of this community. They are different from Community Ads, and including them with your Community Ad campaign for your content will amplify the actions your target audience takes with your ads."

"_communityad_help_sponsored_story_qus_3";"For which of my content can I create Sponsored Stories?"
"_communityad_help_sponsored_story_ans_3";"Different ad packages enable you to create sponsored stories for different content types. Choose the right package to advertise your content."

"_communityad_help_sponsored_story_qus_4";"How do I create Sponsored Stories?"
"_communityad_help_sponsored_story_ans_4";"There are 5 quick steps to create Sponsored Stories : <br /> 
- Choose the best ad package for your requirements. See which one gives you the best options according to your needs <br />
- Choose the content for which you want to create Sponsored Stories <br />
- Target your Sponsored Stories by defining who you want to reach with them, and set a schedule for your Sponsored Stories if you want <br />
- Review your Sponsored Stories to see if everything is fine and looks good <br />
- Make payment for your Sponsored Stories if required <br /><br />

Tips :<br /><br />

- Including Sponsored Stories with your Community Ad campaign for your content will amplify the actions your target audience takes with your ads."

"_communityad_help_sponsored_story_qus_5";"Why am I not able to create Sponsored Stories for my content?"
"_communityad_help_sponsored_story_ans_5";"First, ensure that you have selected the right Ad Package for your Sponsored Stories. The package should allow advertising for your desired content type. Secondly, ensure that you have created some content of the type that you have chosen."

"_communityad_help_sponsored_story_qus_6";"Who will be eligible to see Sponsored Stories?"
"_communityad_help_sponsored_story_ans_6";"The Sponsored Stories of your content will be displayed to users if any of their friends has interacted with your content, and if the user has not already Liked your content. Now once this user Likes your content, his friends will also become eligible to view the Sponsored Stories. This is how your Sponsored Stories and your content will be virally distributed to more and more people with a single Like, thus acting as word-of-mouth recommendation."

"_communityad_help_sponsored_story_qus_7";"What could be the reason that I am not getting the desired response from my Sponsored Stories?"
"_communityad_help_sponsored_story_ans_7";"Sponsored Stories appear organically as a result of user actions on your content. Thus, the number of impressions that you can receive for your Sponsored Stories is dependent on the number of stories about your content. This may cause fluctuations in the number of impressions you are receiving. For this reason, we recommend using a combination of Community Ads and Sponsored Stories to promote your content."
