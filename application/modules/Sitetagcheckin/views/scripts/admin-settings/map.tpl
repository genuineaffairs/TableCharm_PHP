If for this Profile Type, you are mapping a new “Location” type field, then the location which users have entered from their ‘Edit My Location’ page will be automatically synced with the selected field.<br /> Please make sure that this is your final selection, because deleting this field might create inconsistencies on your site for location based members searching."));
