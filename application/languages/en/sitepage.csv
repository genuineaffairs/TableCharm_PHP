Page Profile below. If you would like to show an announcement, or any HTML
content on Page Profiles, and NOT allow Page Owners to be able to remove it,
then you can do that as well below. If there is a widget coming on profiles of
Pages of your site that you want to be removed, then you can do that below; and
many more such actions.
If you drop a widget from a different plugin into the Page Profile, then Page
Owners will NOT be able to remove it or drag-n-drop it. If you ""lock"" a Page
Profile widget that has NOT been placed in the Page Profile Placement area, then
that widget will NOT be available to Page Owners for placing on the Page. If you
""lock"" a Page Profile widget that has been placed in the Page Profile
Placement area, then Page Owners will NOT be able to remove it or drag-n-drop
it.<br />NOTE: If you have placed ""Ad Campaign"" or ""Html Block"" on this page, then
once you click on the ""Save Changes"" link, you will neither be able to change
the position nor edit that block. So, if you want to do so, you will have to
remove that block from the Page and save changes and then place it again from
the Available Blocks."
