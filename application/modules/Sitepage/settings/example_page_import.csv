Even at complete standstill, the car’s enormous power is made visible by its impressive mid-engine, elevated majestically beneath the chassis. Simultaneously, the Veyron’s bold proportions, well-balanced surfaces, and clear line structures give an impression of pure, sleek elegance.The design of the Veyron honors a great heritage without drifting off into retro style. Every detail of the classic two-tone color scheme, a quote from the 1920s and 1930s, has been carefully thought out, resulting in the typical Bugatti profile with the classic, contrasting ellipsis – the stylistic element used by Ettore Bugatti himself. The “crest line”, which runs uninterrupted from the hood to the only 1.21-m-high roof, is a proud homage to the Veyron’s forebears. Thus, the Veyron’s classic paintwork and harmonious design connect this state-of-the-art super sports car to the glorious heritage of Bugatti automobiles.With its classic look, the large radiator grill – adorned with the hand-enameled Bugatti emblem – represents the grandness of the Veyron. The sports car’s distinctive front is defined by the harmonious contrast of its broad headlights and majestic grill. The rear end, 1.99 m wide, features the formidable retractable spoiler and generously designed fenders. The Veyron perfectly fulfills the main design objective governing the development of the new Bugatti: an uncompromising combination of highest elegance and state-of-the-art technology.|car#luxury|queries@bugatti.com|http://www.bugatti.com/|7931441387|1
